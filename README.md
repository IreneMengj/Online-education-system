<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project is an online classroom system specifically for adult vocational skills education based on the B2B2C model. Training institutions can settle in and publish courses on the platform, and the platform will review the published courses. Students can directly select and study free courses, while for charged courses, they need to pay if they want to continue studying. Core modules include content management, media resource management, order payment, authentication and authorization, etc.
